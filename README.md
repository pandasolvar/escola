##Project Background: 

An adult learning centre needs a website portal. Teachers need an easier form to report,access and send their learning materials. The site needs to be easy to access due to some teachers not being as tech-savy as others.

##Requirements: 

Security features for privacy, all access needs to be approved by the learning coordinator. Easy simple interface is a must. The site must be mobile friendly. 

##Solutions: 

linking buttons of the site to the URL from a googledrive, so a static repostory can be made. Assigning folder access for sharing and for that sharing to have a permission request. 

##Set up: 

Each button corresponds to the name of a teacher, the icons for the buttons are game stock images that provide a non specific identifier, taking into consideration the users, an easy to distinguish icon is all that is required. The background is a simple solid colour, that requires no image to be pulled from a different location. The Buttons interfaces have been created to add a game feel, and make the site attractive. 

A url link directly to the shared folder in the googledrive makes the need for a log-in page not required. 

A link to a co-production web app, is also linked to the site. It is a asset management system coded in python, that catalogs all computers at the learning centre. The web app also generates a QR code that corresponds to a particular machine. 

##Goal: To give the innicial steps for the learning centre to go paperless in their activities, future commits planned involve making a editable student register that can be exported to the school's main system.
